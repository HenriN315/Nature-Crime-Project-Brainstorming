## Executive Summary
<p align="right">pg.3</p>
Wilflife crime is a multifaceted environmental, security, health, and economic threat that weakens communities and institutions. It is a transnational phenomenon organized by sophisticated and organized criminal networks that are highly adaptable and intersect with other illicit activities, such as drug trafficking and human trafficking. Requries full coordination across the justice system to address.

### Theory of Change
<p align="right">pg.4</p>

ICCWC recognizes need for both proactive and reactive elements. Theory of Change identifies five critical ICCWC outcomes:
1. Reduced opportunity for wildlife crime.
2. Increased deterrence of wildlife crime.
3. Increased detection of wildlife crime.
4. Increased disruption and detention of ciminals.
5. Evidence-based actions, knowledge exchange and collaboration, as a basis for the achievement of the first four outcomes and to drimve ICCWC's impact.

## Introduction
<p align="right">pg.7</p>

![Figure 1 in document: Importance of the biosphere in achieving the sustainable development goals. Earth's biosphere underpins our societies and economices. Image shows a visual where there are three rings of SDG goals. The biggest and broadest ring that serves as the foundation for the others contains the goals "life below water," "life on land," "climate action," and "clean water and sanitation." The next ring up, of moderate size contains SDG goals pertaining to society, and the very top, smallest ring contains four SDG goals related to the economy.](/nc-notes/nc-images-screenshots/importance-of-biosphere-to-sdl-goals.png)

Illicit financial flows undermine legitimate businesses, and wildlife crime converges with other serious crime, including but not limited to drug, arms, and human trafficking.

No one species makes up more than 5% of incidents. 
Likewise, no one country makes up more than 10% of trade.
These illegal markets are dynamic and are likely to respond to increased regulation by moving operations/trade to countries with weaker frameworks.

World bank estimates costs of illegal exploitation between $1-2 trillion annually. 90% of these losses are from foregone ecosystem services.

## ICCWC Vision
<p align="right">pg.11</p>
### ICCWC Mission
"To strengthen criminal justice systems and provide coordinated support at the national, regional and intercontinental levels to combat wildlife crime."

### Scope of ICCWC
Focuses on national law enforcement and criminal justice systems, but also acknowledges need to address socio-economic causes. They do so by supporting related partners.

### Impact of ICCWC
Emphasizes collaboration and communication with law enforcement to augment anti-WC efforts.
2030 vision: Achieve SDGs by interconnecting wildlife crime with broader env. and socioeconomic goals. 

## ICCWC Theory of Change

Preventing is better than apprehending after the fact, so ICCWC work ranges from proactive to reactive.

![Figure 3: The Five ICCWC Outcomes, ranging from proactive to reactive defenses. The visual depicts five walls with holes (resembling slices of Swiss cheese), each corresponding to one of the five outcomes. Arrows pass through some walls and not others to represent different levels of defense and vulnerability.](/nc-notes/nc-images-screenshots/iccwc-five-outcomes-diagram.png)

### Achieving the Outcomes
**1. Reduced Opportunity for Wildlife Crime**
ICCWC will support member states to reduce opportunity and need for crime. This is a proactive, preventative strategy.
Elements:
* Making it more difficult to commit a wildlife crime.
* Reducing rewards for committing wildlife crime.
* Increasing awareness of wildlife crime.
> "For example, ICCWC will provide support for improved governance;
enhanced controls at crime hotspots and illegal markets; improved
capacity to prevent corruption, money laundering and to trace and seize
assets; and awareness-raising among national authorities and decision
makers."

**2. Increased Deterrence of Wildlife Crime**
Sanction-based strategy.
Elements:
* Increasing the certainty of sanctions.
* Increasing the severity of sanctions.
* Strengthening judicial processes and systems to pursue appropriate sanctions.

**3. Increased Detection of Wildlife Crime**
Elements:
* Increased detection of wildlife crime (pretty redundant)
* Effective gathering of evidence to identify and target suspects and the dynamics of the crimes and criminal networks.

**4. Increased Disruption and Detention of Criminals**
Elements:
* Increase the disruption of criminal activity (again, redundant)
* As appropriate, facilitate arrest and detention of criminals to prevent them from committing further crime.

**5. Evidence-Based Actions, Knowledge Exchange, and Collaboration Drive Impact**
The achievement of the previous four outcomes is dependent upon:
* Evidence-based interventions and decision making to inform collective effort and adaptive management.
* Effective collaboration with and between key stakeholders, which includes relevant national agencies, donors, regional and international initiatives.
* Efficient and effective ICCWC implementation.

### Levels of Organization
Levels of organization refers not only to bureaucratic size but also of what areas and scales we are working on. For example, there isn't much use investing in technological operational capacity without a supportive legal framework.

To ensure sustained change management in pursuit of the coutcomes, ICCWC ill provide support and build capacity at three levels of organization:
1. Institutional

      Work with government to build political will and enhance policy solutions.

2. Organizational
  
      Support key players at higher levels through training and mentorships. E.g. anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering trainings and stuff.

3. Operational and Tactical
  
      Closest to the day-to-day, boots on the ground part of the plan.

### Measuring Success

![Visual of ten items describing success metrics. ](/nc-notes/nc-images-screenshots/iccwc-measuring-success.png)

### Action Plan
What are their "targeted approaches"? How do they tailor support?

### Prioritization
Money and human resources are limiting factors. So, they will prioritize those most committed to the cause, where need is greatest, and where it can bring the most value.
