3. Increased detection of wildlife crime
4. Increased disruption and detention of criminals
5. Evidence-based actions, knowledge exchange and collaboration to drive impact

### WILDLIFE CRIME EXPLAINED
Wildlife crime is interconnected with climate change, ecological balance, socio-economic development, security, public health, and livelihoods. Smugglers/criminals use sophisticated methods to bypass law enforcement and customs officers. Combined with limited human and technological resources, along with corruption and weak institutions, this creates room for them to avoid prosecution. ICCWC supports international and inter-agency coopration/facilitation through a partnership approach.


### KEY 2024 ACTIVITIES: Wildlife crime seizures, investigation and response
Combatted wildlife crime linked to internet in Viet Nam. Trained 20 environmental [olice officers to identify online criminal networks and ensure admissibility of evidence.

Combatted trafficking of endangered timber species. Learned from Operation Thunder 2023 they needed a more comprehensive and interconnected approach to fight timber exchange and supply chain to/from Africa and Asia. Held training for 10 African and Asian countries to enhance capacity and develop common understanding of frameworks in context.

### KEY 2024 ACTIVITIES: Cross-border, regional and international cooperation
Operation Thunder: Annual global operation since 2017. Transnational multi-agency law enforcement approach of customs, police, and wildlife authorities. Increases intelligence, detection capacity, prosecution, etc.
> "Effective data management is essential for customs administrations to refine their risk managment and compliance strategies..."

Held four Regional Investigative and Analytical Case Meetings (RIACMs) on specific cases, including ivory, reptiles, cheetas, etc.
